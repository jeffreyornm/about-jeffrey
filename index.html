<h1>About Jeffrey</h1>
<p>
	Hi everyone! My name is Jeffrey Klein. I am currently 26 years old and have been down here since
	december of last year. I moved down from <strong>Gresham</strong>, <em>Oregon</em> and am excited
	about being down here with you all in Albuquerque.

	<p>
		I have many hobbies which include video gaming, reading, movies, building models, and wood carving.
		I started wood carving as a way to relieve stress. I'm not too good but it does make me feel more
		relaxed when doing so.

  <p>
	  Some of the games I enjoy playing are monster hunter, Guild Wars 2, and Call of duty.
